I am a researcher/computer engineer specializing in geometry processing, computer graphics and computer vision.

Currently, I am a researcher at **Panasonic R&D center Singapore** working on 3D reconstruction technology.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Singapore University of Technology and Design (2018-2020) and Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest (2017) where I developed a novel pipeline for machine knitting and fast solver for the optimal transport problem, respectively.

I did a PhD in computer science at Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, France. My thesis on the perception of geometric distortions on 3D meshes was supervised by Pr. Florent Dupont, Pr. Franck Hétroy-Wheeler and Dr. Kai Wang. The goal of this work was to develop a model that computes a threshold beyond which a geometric distortion on a 3D mesh becomes visible to a human observer.

Outside of work, I enjoy running, hiking and photography.
