I am a researcher in geometry processing, computer graphics and computer vision.

I am currently at **Panasonic R&D center Singapore** working on 3D reconstruction technology.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Singapore University of Technology and Design (2018-2020) and Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest (2017) where I developed a novel pipeline for machine knitting and fast solver for the optimal transport problem, respectively. During my PhD at Universit√© Claude Bernard Lyon 1, I have developped a perceptual model that computes the threshold beyond which a geometric distortion on a 3D mesh becomes visible to a human observer.

Outside of work, I enjoy running, hiking and photography.
