Hello there !!

I am a researcher with a passion for geometry processing, computer graphics and computer vision or as I like to call it the shape, light and eyes of the virtual world.

Currently, I am R&D engineer at **Ubisoft La Forge France** where I spend my days trying to tame neural networks into outputting the right pixels. 

Before that, I spent some time at Panasonic's R&D center in Singapore working on 3D reconstruction. 
I did two postdocs. The first at Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest where I developped a fast solver for the optimal transport problem and the second at Singapore University of Technology and Design where dabbled into machine knitting. During my PhD, I have studied the visibility of vertex displacement on a triangular mesh developped a perceptual model that can predict it.

Beyond the technical stuff, I spend my time playing video games, running, hiking and doing some photography.
