Hello there!

I am a researcher with a passion for geometry processing, computer graphics, and computer vision, or as I like to call it, the shapes, lights, and eyes of the virtual world. 

I am currently a R&D Engineer at **Ubisoft La Forge France** where I spend my days taming neural networks to output the perfect pixels. 

Before that, I spent time at Panasonic's R&D center in Singapore, where I worked on 3D reconstruction. I completed two postdoctoral research positions, the first at Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest where I developed a fast solver for the optimal transport problem, and the second at Singapore University of Technology and Design where I dabbled in the exciting world of machine knitting. During my PhD, I studied the visibility of vertex displacement on a triangular mesh and developed a perceptual model that can predict it.

When I'm not nerding out on technical stuff, you can find me playing video games, running, hiking, and indulging in my passion for photography.
