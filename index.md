## About
I am currently a research enginneer at Panasonic R&D Center Singapore as a member of the IP3D team. 

Previously, I was a Post-doc researcher at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) working on computational tools for machine knitting.
I have also a memeber of Manao Team at INRIA Bordeaux Sud-Ouest where I developped with Dr. Gael Guennebaud a solver for the L2 optimal transport problem in 2D.

I have obtained my a PhD. from Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1. During my PhD, I have worked on the perception geometric distortion of 3D meshes under the supervision of Pr. Florent Dupont, Dr. Franck Hétroy-Wheeler and Dr. Kai Wang. My goal was to develop a method for computing the threshold beyond which a geometric distortion becomes visible.
