  The KnitKit system decouples the high-level design aspect of producing knitted textiles from the complexities and low-level specificity of knitting machines by generating machine knitting instructions from an input 3D geometry and a texture. This enables high-level design of knitting properties, i.e., geometry, yarn types and stitch patterns. Here, we CNC knitted a globe and a glove.

#### Abstract

we introduce **KnitKit**, a flexible and customizable system for the computational design and production of functional, multi-material, and three-dimensional knitted textiles.
Our system greatly simplifies the knitting of 3D objects with complex, varying patterns that use multiple yarns and stitch patterns by separating the high-level design specification in terms of geometry, stitch patterns, materials or colors from the low-level, machine-specific knitting instruction generation.
Starting from a triangular 3D mesh and a 2D texture that specifies knitting patterns on top of the geometry, our system generates the required machine instructions in three major steps.
First, the input is processed and the _KnitNet_ data structure is generated.
This graph structure serves as an abstract interface between the high-level geometric and knitting configuration and the low-level, machine-specific knitting instructions.
Second, a graph rewriting procedure is applied on the KnitNet that produces a sequence of abstract machine actions.
Finally, the low-level machine instructions are generated by adapting those abstract actions to a specific machine context.
We showcase the potential of this computational approach by designing and fabricating a variety of objects with complex geometries, multiple yarns and multiple stitch patterns.
